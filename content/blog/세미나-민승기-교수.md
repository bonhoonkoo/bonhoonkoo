#### Abstract
The role of convection in the scaling of hourly extreme precipitation (EP) with temperature is examined
using convection-permitting regional climate model simulations. The convection-permitting model has
been simulated over South Korea with 2.5 km resolution for current and future conditions. The model is
found to capture the observed super Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) scaling, which is underestimated by a
low resolution simulation based on convective parameterization. When analyzing contributions of
convective versus non-convective type events based on convective available potential energy,
convective events are found to be more important in shaping the super C-C scaling. As the proportion
of convective precipitation increases rapidly with warming, the role of convection in the scaling becomes
dominant. Future projections under high emission scenarios indicate the occurrence of unprecedented
hourly EP events during the late summer season. It is also found that global climate model boundary
conditions affect the EP-temperature scaling by providing different background warming rates.
