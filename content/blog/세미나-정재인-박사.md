#### Abstract
In East Asia, seasonal-scale PM2.5 variability is closely linked to interannual climate
variability, such as the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and the El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). The EAWM influences surface PM2.5 concentrations by up to ±20%
during the winter season in East Asia. In addition, the synoptic meteorological field plays
a crucial role in the daily-scale aerosol variability in this region. In East Asia, the expansion
and contraction of the Siberian high pressure have a significant impact on meteorological
variability, which in turn affects air quality in winter.
In this talk, I will present the impact of meteorological variability on seasonal and daily
changes in winter PM2.5 concentrations in East Asia using an atmospheric chemistry model
and surface PM2.5 observations. Furthermore, based on the correlation between
meteorological variability and PM2.5 concentration, the potential impact of climate change
on future air quality in East Asia will be presented.
